- **Module ID:** `linkMau2`

This module adds a button on anime pages through which you can search the japanese title of the anime on Mau2. Mau2 is a japnese website that provides lists of voice actors for anime.

<Aside type="tip">
Since this button works like a regular link, you can use the middle mouse button (press the scroll wheel) to open the link in a new tab.
