## Module details

You can also click on the "?" icon next to a module to get more information as well as some usage nodes.

## Information tab

At the top, you can switch to the "Information" tab. Here you'll find some information about the extension and its license.

Additionally, you can view the storage usage of extension data. Note: The storage usage of the Mau2 Dictionaries can't be viewed on Firefox. This is due to a Firefox bug that's been present for a long time and has still not been fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience.
