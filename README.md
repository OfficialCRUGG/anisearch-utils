# aniSearch Utils

aniSearch Utils (aSutils for short) is a browser extension that adds various (toggleable) features to aniSearch, mainly intended for *power users*[^1].

[^1]: Wikipedia defines the term "power user" as: "a user [...] who uses advanced features of [...] websites which are not used by the average user. A power user might not have extensive technical knowledge of the systems they use but is rather characterized by competence or desire to make the most intensive use of computer programs or systems.
